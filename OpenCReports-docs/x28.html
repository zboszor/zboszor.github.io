>What is a report generator?</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;				A report generator uses a tabular data source (for example an
				array of data with labels for the column names, or an SQL query)
				and a description file that specifies how to display the data.
				The input data is transformed into various output formats,
				some for human viewing, some for further machine processing.
				Such output formats may be PDF, HTML, XML, plain text or CSV.

				with extensions. See <A

>High level C API</A
> allows loading
				an XML report description that contains all details
				about the report including database access. Mixing
				the high and low level APIs allows a balance anywhere
				between the two extremes, e.g. loading the report
				description but passing database access details via
				program code. RLIB's API and report description allowed
				neither extremes, it relied on the report description
				to provide the layout look, with the data access added
				from programming code.

>2/3</TT
> is two constants
				in a division. This is precomputed into a single

			</P

				The build that disabled UTF-8 support relied on
				single byte character set encodings and conversion
				between them. That wasn't always reliable. Since that

>High precision numeric data type</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;				For historic record, RLIB was designed for the US
				and slower machines. It used a fixed point numeric
				representation. For the US, with its strong currency
				and prices expressed in low numbers, this was an
				acceptable design decision. But for countries, whose
				currencies are a few orders of magnitude weaker and
				conversely, the prices are similarly higher, the fixed
				point numeric value range was easily overflown, leading
				to wrong data in the report output.
			</P
><P
>&#13;				Another potential problem with the fixed point numeric
				representation was that converting numbers from the
				input data to this internal representation always and
				unconditionally rounded down. This can be demonstrated
				with a carefully constructed (small) data set that would
				add up exactly to 100% both on paper and with using the
				IEEE-754 <TT
CLASS="literal"
>double</TT
> data type, it would
				only add up to 99.99% with RLIB's internal numeric
				representation.
			</P
><P
>&#13;				To avoid these kind of problems, OpenCReports uses
				GNU MPFR floating point values with 256-bit precision
				by default. This allows storing very large and very small
				numbers. E.g. this allows computations even with late
				stage
				<A

				prices.

>Automatic input data conversion</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;				For maximum portability, databases provide their
				data in strings. They also provide metadata that
				describes the data type of every column in the
				data record.
			</P
><P
>&#13;				RLIB relied on explicit data conversion functions,
				like <TT
CLASS="literal"
>val()</TT
> and
				<TT
CLASS="literal"
>stodt()</TT
>.
			</P
><P
>&#13;				OpenCReports discovers the columns' data type
				and applies the conversion automatically. For
				RLIB compatibility, the conversion functions
				pass through values as is if they are already
				converted. For example, the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>val()</TT
>
				function accepts an operand with both string and
				numeric data types. In the former case the conversion
				to numeric is performed, but if the operand is
				already numeric, no further conversion takes place.
				This is user friendly in two aspects: the conversion
				function is not necessary when implementing a new
				report, and an already existing RLIB report (that
				contains such conversion functions for the input data)
				may be used as is.

>Versatile field alignment and multi-row fields</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;				In the report output, fields may have a fixed width in
				which they are displayed. Some field values are longer
				that the field width. When displaying them in a single
				row, fields may be left-, right- or center-aligned.
				With the PDF output, this means pixel-perfect alignment
				with the parts of the field value that don't fit masked
				off visually. RLIB aligned the data actually truncated
				to fit into the field width.
			</P
><P
>&#13;				Fields longer than the designated width may be wrapped
				either at word or character boundaries. This way, they
				become multi-row fields. RLIB called them "memo" fields
				and the XML report description in OpenCReports also
				uses the same naming for the flags dealing with this
				detail. Multi-row fields are configurable regading word
				or character wrapping, or they may be limited to print
				only a certain amount of lines. Memo fields can break
				over column or page boundaries.
			</P
><P
>&#13;				OpenCReports have some differences from RLIB regards to
				memo fields.
			</P
><P
>&#13;				Thanks to Pango rendering, when using character wrapping,
				hyphenation is done.
			</P
><P
>&#13;				The second extension over RLIB is that
				<TT
CLASS="literal"
>justified</TT
> alignment can also be
				used for multi-line fields. This is also thanks to
				Pango. When <TT
CLASS="literal"
>justified</TT
> alignment is
				used, all lines but the last are justified. Therefore,
				<TT
CLASS="literal"
>justified</TT
> alignment equivalent to
				<TT
CLASS="literal"
>left</TT
> alignment for single line fields.

>PDF output format, fonts, layout details</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;				By using the excellent drawing possibilities of
				Cairo or later, OpenCReports supports generating
				the report in PDF format. RLIB relied on an
				internal PDF generator in earlier versions called
				RPDF, and used libHaru in later versions.
			</P
><P
>&#13;				In RLIB, sizing of other details are a mix of units,
				making it harder to design the report layout:
				<P
></P
><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>&#13;							field widths and report heights are in
							number of characters
						</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>&#13;							width of lines are in points (1/72th inch)
						</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>&#13;							width of gaps between columns of a
							multi-column report is in inches
						</P
></LI
></UL
>
			</P
><P
>&#13;				OpenCReports faithfully reimplements these
				for compatibility.
			</P
><P
>&#13;				However, there are problems with field widths
				calculated in number of characters. Widths using
				a 12 point font is not the same as widths using
				a 20 point font. Also, font width and height are
				usually not identical. Some fonts are lean, with
				their width smaller than their height. RLIB expected
				that fonts are using the same character width and
				height. For this reason, RLIB only supported a small
				variety of monospace fonts.
			</P
><P
>&#13;				Also, character widths for proportional fonts differ.
				Field width expressed in number of characters cannot
				be exact when using  proportional fonts. For this reason,
				RLIB didn't support proportional fonts at all.
			</P
><P
>&#13;				OpenCReports extended upon these ideas, so individual
				fields in a text line may use custom font settings
				while keeping the field width calculation identical
				to RLIB, which ends with the font parameters set for
				the text line. In OpenCReports, The custom field font
				settings (font name and size) don't influence the field
				width. Using this method, OpenCReports may use proportional
				fonts even with using the RLIB compatible size settings.
			</P
><P
>&#13;				On top of that, OpenCReports also has a new, consistent
				size calculation method where everything is measured in
				points.
